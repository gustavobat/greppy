# `greppy`

A Rust implementation of a `grep`-like tool, originally built as a solution for 
[CodeCrafters _"Build your own grep"_](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/grep/overview) challenge.

## Features
- Zero-copy of the testing string,
- UTF-8 support,
- Wildcards,
- Positive/negative char groups,
- Start and end anchors,
- Quantifiers,
- Capture groups & backreferences.

## Missing features
- Ranges: `a{2,3}`,
- Word boundary: `\b`,
- _Non_-classes: `\W, \D, \B`

## Usage

####  Piping from standard input:

```sh
$ echo "123 foo 456 bar 123 baz 456" | cargo run --release -- -E "(\d+).*(\d+).*\1.*\2"
```
> 123 foo 456 bar 123 baz 456

#### From a file:

```sh
$ echo "How many yaks could a yak-pack pack if a yak-pack could pack yaks?" > file.txt
$ cargo run --release -- -E "How many ((yak)s) could a (\2-(pack)) \4 if a \3 could \4 \1?" file.txt
```

> file.txt:How many yaks could a yak-pack pack if a yak-pack could pack yaks?

#### From multiple files/directories (with recursive `-r` option enabled):

```sh
$ mkdir -p dir/subdir
$ echo "🦦 🦦 🦦" > dir/subdir/file.txt
$ echo "🐼 🐼 🐼" > another_file.txt
$ cargo run --release -- -r -E "(.*) \1 \1" dir another_file.txt
```

> dir/subdir/file.txt:🦦 🦦 🦦  
> another_file.txt:🐼 🐼 🐼
